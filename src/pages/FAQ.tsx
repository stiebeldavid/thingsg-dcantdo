      question: "Why is it blank?",
      answer: "Because there are no things G-d can't do."
    },
    {
      question: "Am I supposed to fill in the blank space myself?",
      answer: "No! It's already filled in."
    },
    {
      question: "So there's really nothing G-d can't do?",
      answer: "Exactly."
    },
    {
      question: "Can G-d create a rock so heavy that He can't lift it?",
      answer: "Yes."
    },
    {
      question: "Ha! That means He can't lift it!",
      answer: "Actually, He can lift it."
    },
    {
      question: "Waitâ€”then He can't create such a rock in the first place!",
      answer: "No, He can do that too."
    },
    {
      question: "That doesn't make any sense. It's a paradox!",
      answer: "G-d is not limited by our ability to understand what He can and cannot do."
    },
    {
      question: "Woah.",
      answer: "Yes. Woah is right."
    },
    {
      question: "But what about something really impossible?",
      answer: "Nope, He can do all those things, too."
    },
    {
      question: "But that would require a miracle. He can't do impossible things within nature.",
      answer: "Nope, He can even do impossible things without using miracles, completely within natural means."
    },
    {
      question: "But everyone would notice and know that He did it.",
      answer: "Not necessarily. G-d does many amazing (and seemingly impossible) things that many people just ascribe to coincidence or happenstance. It's a choice whether to notice G-d or not."
